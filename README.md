# OOP-Design
Marty Marinda & Isabella Devassy's OOP Design Project based on [this](https://github.com/Tech-at-DU/ACS-1111-Object-Oriented-Programming/blob/master/Lessons/oop_design_challenge.md) tutorial repo.

# Overview
This Project is revolved around a store that is broken into groceries, departments, and products. Its features includes class methods, inheritance, composition, encapsulation and polymorphism.

First we created a class for store that returns the employee name and then it's called through the get_cart method that returns a string. The capacity of the store is expressed as well.

In addition different classes are created that is inherited from store.

# How to Use
